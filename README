You must have a Java compiler installed in your computer to compile the java files.

Assume your working directory is James_Zhou_Proj11.

To compile the java files, we need to compile SymbolTable.java first. Type

	javac SymbolTable.java

Then type

	javac JackCompiler.java

to compile JackCompiler.

Then compile the test programs

	e.g. java JackCompiler Average/Main.jack

Load the correspoinding directory to VMEmulator to test the compiler. 

(note1: JackCompiler can compile ONE jack file at one time.)
(note2: JackCompiler passes all the test programs except ComplexArrays.)
